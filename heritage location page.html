          Anuradhapura is the first capital of Sri Lanka located in north central province of Sri Lanka. It is one of the ancient capitals of Sri Lanka which was the center of Theravada Buddhism for many centuries. Due to its ruins of an ancient Sri Lankan civilization UNESCO named it as a UNESCO world heritage site in 1982 under the name of Sacred City of Anuradhapura.
Sacred City of Anuradhapura
This sacred city was established around a cutting from the 'tree of enlightenment', the Buddha's fig tree, brought there in the 3rd century B.C. by Sanghamitta, the founder of an order of Buddhist nuns. Anuradhapura, a Ceylonese political and religious capital that flourished for 1,300 years, was abandoned after an invasion in 993. Hidden away in dense jungle for many years, the splendid site, with its palaces, monasteries and monuments, is now accessible once again.

                <br><br><br><br>Polonnaruwa Kingdom or the Ancient city of Polonnaruwa was the second capital of Sri Lanka for three centuries between the 11th to 13th century after the destruction of Anuradhapura Kingdom in 993. It is located in north central province of Sri Lanka. Due to its archeological prominence and the ancient technological superiority UNESCO declared Polonnaruwa as a World Heritage in 1982 under the name of Ancient City of Polonnaruwa.
Polonnaruwa was the second capital of Sri Lanka after the destruction of Anuradhapura in 993. It comprises, besides the Brahmanic monuments built by the Cholas, the monumental ruins of the fabulous garden-city created by Parakramabahu I in the 12th century.

                   Dambulla cave temple also known as the Golden Temple of Dambulla is a World Heritage Site (1991) in Sri Lanka, situated in the central part of the country. This site is situated 148 kilometres (92 mi) east of Colombo, 72 kilometres (45 mi) north of Kandy and 43 km (27 mi) north of Matale.

Dambulla is the largest and best-preserved cave temple complex in Sri Lanka. The rock towers 160 m over the surrounding plains. There are more than 80 documented caves in the surrounding area. Major attractions are spread over five caves, which contain statues and paintings. These paintings and statues are related to Gautama Buddha and his life. There are a total of 153 Buddha statues, three statues of Sri Lankan kings and four statues of gods and goddesses. The latter include Vishnu and the Ganesha. The murals cover an area of 2,100 square metres (23,000 sq ft). Depictions on the walls of the caves include the temptation by the demon Mara, and Buddha's first sermon.

                    <br><br><br><br><br><br>Sigiriya, also called Lion Rock or Lion Mountain, site in central Sri Lanka consisting of the ruins of an ancient stronghold that was built in the late 5th century CE on a remarkable monolithic rock pillar. The rock, which is so steep that its top overhangs the sides, rises to an elevation of 1,144 feet (349 metres) above sea level and is some 600 feet (180 metres) above the surrounding plain.
The ruins of the capital built by the parricidal King Kassapa I (477–95) lie on the steep slopes and at the summit of a granite peak standing some 180m high (the 'Lion's Rock', which dominates the jungle from all sides). A series of galleries and staircases emerging from the mouth of a gigantic lion constructed of bricks and plaster provide access to the site.

                 Situated on a central plateau, the sacred city of Kandy is the second largest city in Sri Lanka. Kandy rose to prominence in 1470 when it became the capital of the island nation. To accommodate the needs of the newly resident royal family and nobles, a "Medieval Grid City" was laid out next to the sacred temple area. This grid city is unique in South Asia and contains 486 historic buildings. Kandy remained a civic center and the capital city of Sri Lanka until 1815, when the British conquered the island. Kandy is now best known as the location of the Annual Tooth Relic Procession, a festival that dates back to the fourth century, when the relic, which is said to be a tooth of the Buddha, was brought to Sri Lanka. Every year, five religious institutions of the Theravada, Mahayana, and Hindu faiths produce an elaborate nighttime procession through Kandy that includes 100 elephants and 5,000 drummers and dancers, as well as the procession of the Tooth Relic. Kandy Sacred City was added to the World Heritage List in 1988. 
This sacred Buddhist site, popularly known as the city of Senkadagalapura, was the last capital of the Sinhala kings whose patronage enabled the Dinahala culture to flourish for more than 2,500 years until the occupation of Sri Lanka by the British in 1815. It is also the site of the Temple of the Tooth Relic (the sacred tooth of the Buddha), which is a famous pilgrimage site.

               <img src="images/colombo/negambo.png" alt="Negambo beach" width="500" style="float: right; margin-left: 40px;"> 
            Only an hour from Colombo, not far from the airport, Negombo has a cool little village atmosphere. Catering to tourists, the beach has a shoreline dotted with restaurants and tiny shops selling handicrafts. There are also bands and musicians playing along the beach, adding to the lively vibe. The beach is wide and flat, with beach chair and umbrella rentals available from enterprising locals. You can find every kind of water sport imaginable here, both rentals and lessons. Be careful; the sea here can be rough for swimming and has strong currents.

 <h1>Nilavell beach</h1>

                <img src="images/colombo/Nilavelli.png" alt="Nilavelli beach" width="500" style="float: left; margin-right: 40px;">
                <br><br><br><br>Nilaveli Beach is a broad, sandy beach, lined with palm trees and dotted with fishermen's boats. Located on the northeast part of Sri Lanka, it's a 30-minute drive from the city of Trincomalee. This tiny island has calm beaches with gentle surf due to its own small reef. Although the beach at Nilaveli is large, it is popular with both locals and tourists. There are lifeguards on duty and many little restaurants along the beach, most specializing in seafood.

The Trincomalee area is also good for sightseeing, as it's a center of Tamil culture. Tamil is the name of the language spoken in Sri Lanka and the ethnic group to which the majority of its residents belong.

        <h1>Arugam Bay</h1>
        <div class="overflowparas">
            <div class="para2">
                <p>
                    <img src="images/colombo/Arugam Bay.png" alt="Arugam Bay" width="500" style="float: right; margin-left: 40px;">
                   Arugam Bay is dramatically beautiful, with bright white sand and deep blue water gradually becoming green the closer you get to the shore. With that beauty comes some of the best surf breaks in Sri Lanka, and the beach is known as an international surf destination. This reputation brings many visitors but also means the area has a good tourist infrastructure and is easy to access. The curving beach feels a bit like a Hawaiian beach - the area near the water slopes down, and there's a dry, sandy section, then rougher areas with shrubs and a tree line.

Right on Arugam Bay, The Spice Trail is a cool, little luxury resort with individual villa accommodations. Each has its own small outdoor garden area, perfect for relaxing on a lounge chair. Attractions nearby include ancient temples and Kumana National Park, known for the many species of birds that live in or migrate through the area.

<h1>Hikkaduwa Bay</h1>

                    <img src="images/colombo/Hikkaduwa.png" alt="Hikkaduwa beach" width="500" style="float: left; margin-right: 40px;">
                    <br><br><br><br><br><br>Another beach known for its strong surf and good surfing, Hikkaduwa is in the southwest, close to Galle and about 95 kilometers from Colombo. The beach is typical of those in Sri Lanka, backed with dense foliage and palm trees. The water here is bright aqua and the sand is fine and white. A national park lies behind the beach area. It's one of only three marine national parks in the country and has its own coral sanctuary. In addition to the coral, the park is known for its marine turtles and fish.

        <h1>Bentota beach</h1>

                   <img src="images/colombo/Bentota.png" alt="Bentota" width="500" style="float: right; margin-right: 40px;">
                  Bentota is a popular resort town, only an hour from Colombo. It sees many package tourists but retains its spectacular natural beauty and is worth a visit. The sand is bright white on this wide beach, and the sea is bright aqua-blue due to its light-colored sandy bottom. The beach is surrounded by jungle and tall palm trees. Nearby attractions include many temples and remnants of the country's colonial past, like a fort protecting the old harbor of Galle.

The Vivanta by Taj - Bentota, part of the Indian Taj hotel chain, is a large property, with some rooms and suites overlooking the sea.
                </p>
<h1>Unawatuna beach</h1>
                    <img src="images/colombo/Unawatuna.png" alt="Unawatuna" width="500" style="float: left; margin-right: 40px;">
                    <br><br><br><br><br><br>Unawatuna and its beach are near the colonial town of Galle, which is a great city for sightseeing. Sri Lanka was formerly a colony of both Portugal and Holland (at different times), and this was the country's main city during that time. About five kilometers outside Galle, Unawatuna offers another little bit of beach paradise.

The area, also a big destination for ecotourism, has a large coral reef offshore. The beach is large and curving but can be crowded as it's considered one of the country's best beach resorts. CoCo Bay Unawatuna is a well-appointed beachfront resort with its own little private section of the beach with lounge chairs.
